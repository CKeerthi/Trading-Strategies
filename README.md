# Trading Strategies

## This repository consists of 2 files:
1. Long/Short equity algorithm
2. Mean reversion algorithm

## What tools did I use?
- For the Long/short equity code, I used Jupyter notebooks to import data, modify, and visualize it using pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib
- For mean reversion, I used Quantopians notebok and their pipeline data to visualize and backtest. This code only works if you have access to Quantopians pipeline

## What is Long/Short equity?
Long/short equity is an investing strategy that takes long positions in stocks that are expected to appreciate and short positions in stocks that are expected to decline. A long/short equity strategy seeks to minimize market exposure while profiting from stock gains in the long positions, along with price declines in the short positions. Although this may not always be the case, the strategy should be profitable on a net basis.

## What is Mean Reversion?
Mean reversion is a theory used in finance that suggests that asset prices and historical returns eventually will revert to the long-run mean or average level of the entire dataset. This mean can pertain to another relevant average, such as economic growth or the average return of an industry.

It's used as part of a statistical analysis of market conditions and can be part of an overall trading strategy. It applies well to the ideas of buying low and selling high, by hoping to identify abnormal activity that will, theoretically, revert to a normal pattern. Mean reversion has also been used in options pricing to describe the observation that an asset's volatility will fluctuate around some long-term average.
